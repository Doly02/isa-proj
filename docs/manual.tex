\section{Assignment}
The project assignment in the ISA (Network Applications and Network Administration) subject was 
to create IMAP4rev1 (according to RFC3501), which will be able to communicate only over TCP/IP as well 
as using SLL/TLS - IMAPS. The following program downloads emails from the defined server in the argument 
of the program call and saves them in the output directory. If the path to the output repository 
specified by the argument does not exist, the program creates it on this path.

\section{Implementation Details}
The principles of object-oriented programming have been applied to the program code. The program is 
divided into logical classes such as the \verb!ClientConfig! class - which takes care of the configuration 
of the resulting IMAP client based on the input arguments of the program, which it also processes. 
On the result of the configuration, either an instance of the \verb!NonSecureImapClient! class is created, 
which mediates communication, classically only over TCP/IP, or an instance of the \verb!SecureImapClient! 
class, which also uses SSL/TLS in addition to TCP/IP. Both classes \verb!NonSecureImapClient! and 
\verb!SecureImapClient! inherit basic properties from \verb!BaseImapClient!, which provides features 
that are common to both derived classes, such as generating a TAG, finding the value of the current TAG or translating 
a hostname to an IPv4 address. 

\subsection{Implementation of Client}
The NonSecureImapClient and SecureClient classes are characterized by their very 
similar behavior, at the beginning when the class is instantiated they receive information 
like \verb!MailBox!, \verb!OutputDirectory!, \\ 
\verb!HeadersOnly! and \verb!NewOnly! as input parameters. These parameters are used to define 
further behavior of the program and their description is given in table below.

\smallskip

\begin{center}
    \vspace{0.5cm} % Space before table
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
        \hline
        \textbf{Parameter} & \textbf{Description} \\
        \hline
        MailBox & Mailbox from which emails will be downloaded \\
        \hline
        OutputDirectory & Specifies where downloaded emails will be stored \\
        \hline
        HeadersOnly & Only header of the emails will be downloaded \\
        \hline
        NewOnly & Only unseen emails will be downloaded \\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \vspace{0.5cm} % Space after table
\end{center}

Then, from the user's point of view, the classes only need to call the Run method with the parameters 
server address, port login and password. This method interacts with the server and its behaviour is as follows.

\subsection{Program's Features}

\subsubsection{Usage of UIDVALIDITY Value}
The program also contains some of the extra features, the first of which is that the client 
saves a special \verb!.uidvalidity! file with the value \verb!UIDVALIDITY! when downloading 
to a specific output directory for the first time, this value is used in case the user wants 
to repeatedly download files to the same \verb!output! \verb!directory! and have synchronized mailboxes. 
On each subsequent run, the \verb!UIDVALIDITY! value is checked to see if it is the same locally 
(in this \verb!.uidvalidity! file) and on the server, if the values are different, 
it is a sign that the structure of the mailbox on the server has changed (i.e. the emails 
have been removed or moved to another mailbox, etc.) and the output directory needs to be purged 
and the emails downloaded again. 
The \verb!.uidvalidity! file is formatted according to the rule that each \verb!mailbox! has its 
corresponding line, which contains the mailbox name followed by the equal and finally the 
\verb!uidvalidity value! for the given mailbox. Note that the file is not associated with the 
name of the IMAP server or user account, so it is recommended to download only emails from 
multiple mailboxes of one account to one output directory to maintain clarity and easy orientation 
in the application output.

An example of the `.uidvalidity` file content:

\begin{verbatim}
INBOX=1662988148
SPECIFIC_MAILBOX1=1662988155
SPECIFIC_MAILBOX2=1362922155
\end{verbatim}

In this example:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{INBOX=1662988148} indicates that the \texttt{uidvalidity} value for the "INBOX" mailbox is\\ \texttt{1662988148}.
    \item \texttt{SPECIFIC\_MAILBOX1=1662988155} indicates that the \texttt{uidvalidity} value\\ 
    for the "SPECIFIC\_MAILBOX1" mailbox is \texttt{1662988155}.
    \item \texttt{SPECIFIC\_MAILBOX2=1362922155} indicates that the \texttt{uidvalidity} value\\
     for the "SPECIFIC\_MAILBOX2" mailbox is \texttt{1362922155}.
\end{itemize}

This is done to ensure that the locally downloaded emails are always synchronized with those 
on the server and to allow users to download emails from multiple mailboxes to a single output 
directory. 

\subsubsection{Creation of Output Directory}
The client always needs to have a specific \verb!output directory! to which it will download emails 
from the IMAP server, it can happen that the user specifies his/her own location, but the 
folder on the given path does not exist (for example \verb!-o /Desktop/email/my_mailbox/!) in 
this case the client is able to create the folder on the given path 
(in this example on \verb!/Desktop/email/my_mailbox/!) and store the emails in it.

\subsubsection{Store Emails From Multiple Mailboxes Into One Output Directory}
The user of \verb!imapcl! has the possibility to download emails from several mailboxes 
into one \verb!output! directory, the names of output files with saved emails are defined 
according to the \verb!UID value! of the given email and according to the \verb!mailbox! 
to which the email is saved. it is highly recommended not to mix emails e.g. from two IMAP 
servers into one output directory, in case of a mailbox name match the emails from the previous 
download will be deleted and replaced by the current download.

\subsubsection{Gentle Download}
The program also introduces a \textbf{gentle download}, i.e. emails are downloaded only if the 
emails are downloaded to a given output directory for the first time, or the structure of 
the local copy of the mailbox or the structure on the IMAP server has changed. For example, 
in a local folder where emails have been downloaded once before, some email(s) in the folder 
have been removed (perhaps by mistake) or the mailbox on the IMAP server has been modified 
and the \verb!UIDVALIDITY! value has changed. The client is always in sync with the IMAP server.

\subsubsection{What If Server Does Sends Any Response?}
In order to prevent the program from freezing due to waiting for a response from the server, 
a timeout is set on the sockets (20 seconds for the unsecure version of the program, 
30 seconds for the secure version). These values can be configured using the macros 
\verb!TIMEOUT_NON_SECURE! and \verb!TIMEOUT_SECURE! in the \textbf{\textit{definitions.hpp}} 
file located in the \textbf{\textit{include}} folder.

\subsection{Known Limitations}
A user's mailbox can often be bulky and contain a number of large emails whose size can exceed 30MB, 
in which case it was observed during testing that downloading the entire mailbox can take a 
considerable amount of time and should be taken into account. 

\subsection{Adjustable Definitions}
The relevant adjustable definitions are defined in the \textbf{\textit{definitions.hpp}} file in the \textbf{\textit{include}} folder. 
Some of them can be modified according to the user's needs, here is the content of the 
editable definitions:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{PORT\_NON\_SECURE} - Default port for non-secure mode if the client does not specify one. The default value is \texttt{143}.
    
    \item \texttt{TIMEOUT\_SECURE} - Timeout for receiving data from the IMAP server in secure mode, defined in seconds. The default value is \texttt{30s}.
    
    \item \texttt{DEFAULT\_SSL\_CERT\_LOC} - Default location of SSL certificates, set to \texttt{/etc/ssl/certs}.
    
    \item \texttt{DEFAULT\_MAILBOX\_DIR} - Default mailbox directory, set to \texttt{INBOX}.
    
    \item \texttt{UIDVALIDITY\_FILE} - Filename for storing UID validity information, set to \texttt{.uidvalidity.txt}.
    
    \item \texttt{PORT\_SECURE} - Default port for secure mode if the client does not specify one. The default value is \texttt{993}.
    
    \item \texttt{TIMEOUT\_NON\_SECURE} - Timeout for receiving data from the IMAP server in non-secure mode, defined in seconds. The default value is \texttt{20s}.
    
    \item \texttt{OUTPUT\_FILE\_FORMAT} - Format for output files, set to \texttt{.log}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Program Flow}
The behaviour of the program has already been mentioned, this chapter contains a more detailed 
description and the program flow diagram shows the behaviour of the client in graphical form.

The program parses the program arguments at the beginning - find out how the client should be 
configured. Next, a client is created according to the request, which establishes a connection 
to the IMAP server using only \verb!TCP/IP! or a combination of \verb!TCP/IP! with \verb!SSL/TLS!.
If the connection is established, it sends a \verb!LOGIN! command to the server, which should log 
the user in. In case of successful login, the SELECT command selects the \verb!mailbox! from which 
the user wants to download emails (note: the default is \verb!INBOX!), next, the \verb!UIDVALIDITY! 
value is verified against the local copy (if the local copy does not exist in the 
\verb!output directory!, it is created). Then all \verb!UIDs! related to the mailbox are retrieved using 
the \verb!FETCH! command (the collection of retrieved \verb!UIDs! can be influenced by this parameter if the 
\verb!'-n'! argument is used). After the set of \verb!UIDs! is obtained, the email download sequence 
starts, the emails are downloaded one by one only - if is not yet downloaded locally into this specific output directory 
and the rest of the communication with the IMAP client is removed. Finally, the email is stored 
in the output directory specified by the \verb!'-o'! argument and the client repeats this 
process with the next email with a UID from the set of pending emails.

\subsection{Classes}
This section contains a visualization of the main program classes using a diagram based on 
the use-case diagram. The aim of these diagrams was to capture the individual classes and the 
methods/operations they allow.

\subsubsection{ClientConfig}
A class for processing user arguments, which is also responsible for storing the configuration 
of the future IMAP Client.

    }
    \caption{Class ClientConfig and ClientConfig Methods}
    \label{figure:client-config}
\end{figure}

\newpage

\subsubsection{ImapClients}
Here it may be seen that both \verb!SecureImapClient! and \verb!NonSecureImapClient! 
have a common ancestor, which is \verb!BaseImapClient! - providing common methods for 
both successors. On the basis of the configuration, an instance of the \verb!SecureImapClient! 
or \verb!NonSecureImapClient! class is created, it is responsible for taking care of 
the whole process of communication with the IMAP server and storing the results.

    \label{figure:imap-clients}
\end{figure}

\section{Testing}
The \verb!imapcl! program has also been tested. The testing was performed in two ways, 
the first one was tested using the local implementation of the IMAP server, the second 
way was chosen to test on foreign IMAP servers provided by the school such as eva or merlin.

\newpage

\subsection{Testing of Local IMAP Server}
To ensure the correct operation of the program, \texttt{imapcl} was tested using a local 
implementation of the IMAP server. The local IMAP server is available in the repository 
in the tests folder under the name \texttt{imap\_server.py}. The server is implemented in Python 
using the \texttt{os}, \texttt{socket}, \texttt{threading}, \texttt{subprocess}, 
\texttt{time}, and \texttt{signal} libraries and handles all requests from the client 
implementation such as \texttt{LOGIN}, \texttt{FETCH} (fetch support involves responding to 
specific requests such as \texttt{'tag' UID 'x' FETCH BODY[HEADER]} or \texttt{'tag' UID 'x' FETCH BODY[TEXT]} 
where \texttt{'tag'} is specific tag of the request and \texttt{'x'} is UID of the email), 
\texttt{SELECT}, and \texttt{LOGOUT}.

The tests folder also contains the test\_emails folder with sample emails that are sent to 
the IMAP client, at the same time these emails are used to compare what was sent with what 
was received on the IMAP client, the contents should be the same - the result of the 
comparison is displayed in the output of the script \texttt{imap\_server.py}.

The local IMAP server was used for basic testing of the application functionality, 
and at a later stage of development it was used to simulate errors and unusual conditions 
that can occur during communication between client and server.

\subsection{Testing of Foreign IMAP Servers}
As a complementary method, testing on foreign IMAP servers provided by the school, such as eva 
or merlin, was chosen to ensure compatibility outside the local environment and to demonstrate 
the usability of the program.

\section{Return Codes}
The program is designed in such a way that in case of an error or failure, the user 
is always informed about the situation that has occurred. In case of success the program 
always returns the return value 0 (respectively \verb!SUCCESS!), in other cases the program gives the return 
values according to the table below.
